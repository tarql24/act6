    <h1>Snakes</h1>
    <h2>Coolest Animal on the Planet</h2>
    <p>These animals are so calm and easy to deal with. They have been misunderstood because of how they are portrayed on TV or because of the posionous variations too.</p>
    <p class="fab">They possess a surprising strength and quickness in order to catch its prey.</p>
    <p class="coolfont">Their jaws actually disconnect in order to swallow its food, which it has to swallow whole because they don't have conventional teeth. </p>
